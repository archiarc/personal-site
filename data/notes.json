But if that's all you know about me, you're missing most of the picture.</p><p>I spend a lot of time thinking about consciousness, discipline, and what freedom actually looks like. I meditate. I study Buddhism and Taoism, not as aesthetics, but as operating systems for life. I do yoga (poorly, but I show up). When I'm near water, I'm surfing or paddling. I eat well and care about it. I have a dog who's better company than most humans.</p><h2>What actually interests me:</h2><ul><li>How systems work: markets, people, myself</li><li>Long-term thinking in a short-term world</li><li>Building things that compound</li><li>Good food, good conversations, good silence</li></ul><p>I don't believe in grinding until you break. I believe in leverage, energy management, and living a life worth having, not just one that looks impressive on paper.</p><p>This site is my public notebook. No branding department. No PR filter.

      "content": "<p>Chronological. Honest. No spin.</p><p>Every project taught me something. Some lessons cost more than others.</p><hr><h2>Attention Labs (2025-Present)</h2><p>Growth and strategy work: applying business fundamentals that have worked for a century, supercharged with AI tools. The goal is simple: help teams do 10-100x more without burning out.</p><p><strong>What's working:</strong> Built frameworks that actually stick. Integrated AI into real workflows (not just demos). Helped teams move faster while staying sane.</p><p><strong>What's still messy:</strong> Early days. Still experimenting. Still figuring out how to explain what we do without sounding like everyone else.</p><p><strong>The lesson:</strong> Tools matter. But thinking clearly matters more.</p><hr><h2>Quid (2024-2025)</h2><p>Crypto-native card + IBAN built on Hyperliquid. Real product, real demand, real regulatory headaches.</p><p><strong>What worked:</strong> Strong community from day one. Designed UX that made sense to actual crypto users. Proved there's appetite for this.</p><p><strong>What didn't:</strong> Underestimated how slow fintech moves. Regulatory complexity ate our speed. Operational overhead was brutal.</p><p><strong>The lesson:</strong> Fintech isn't a product problem. It's legal, ops, and patience - mostly patience.</p><hr><h2>Eight Forces (2023-2024)</h2><p>Web3 growth agency. Worked with projects that raised tens of millions and hit 9 - figure valuations.</p><p><strong>What worked:</strong> Record campaigns. Real results. Strong reputation.</p><p><strong>What didn't:</strong> Scaling culture is hard. Burnout was a real risk - for me and the team.</p><p><strong>The lesson:</strong> Systems scale. Chaos doesn't. No matter how smart the chaos is.</p><hr><h2>Intropia (2021-2023)</h2><p>Decentralized recruitment platform. Solo founder. Built a network of hundreds of top crypto people.</p><p><strong>What worked:</strong> Raised from great angels. Built something real. Created genuine community.</p><p><strong>What didn't:</strong> Never cracked monetization. Timing was off.</p><p><strong>The lesson:</strong> Being early feels like being smart. Until you realize you're just waiting.</p><hr><h2>Frontrunners / Make It in Ukraine (2018-2021)</h2><p>Recruitment agency connecting EU/US companies with Ukrainian talent. Built a strong reputation with major tech companies.</p><p><strong>What worked:</strong> Great clients. Good revenue. Real impact on people's careers.</p><p><strong>What didn't:</strong> Services hit a ceiling. Hard to scale without breaking quality.</p><p><strong>The lesson:</strong> Service businesses trade time for money. That's not leverage.</p><hr><h2>BHSL Community (2019-2022)</h2><p>Weekly founder breakfasts in Kyiv. Started as an experiment, became a real community that's still running.</p><p><strong>What worked:</strong> Genuine relationships. No agenda. People kept showing up.</p><p><strong>What didn't:</strong> Never monetized it.</p><p><strong>The lesson:</strong> Not everything needs to make money. Some things are just worth doing.</p><hr><h2>Robonomics (2020-2021)</h2><p>IoT meets blockchain. CMO role. Took it from $4M to $80M market cap.</p><p><strong>What worked:</strong> Massive attention. Boston Dynamics integration. Story that resonated.</p><p><strong>What didn't:</strong> Market volatility hit hard.</p><p><strong>The lesson:</strong> Great narrative + real tech = force multiplier. But you can't control the market.</p><hr><h2>Sustainable Rentals (2019-2020)</h2><p>Eco - friendly rental business. Happy customers, strong brand, bad unit economics.</p><p><strong>The lesson:</strong> Loving what you do doesn't mean it'll make money.</p><hr><h2>Custom Paintings (2018-2019)</h2><p>Personalized art e - commerce. Good revenue, loyal customers, seasonal ceiling.</p><p><strong>The lesson:</strong> Know your ceiling before you hit it.</p><hr><h2>Byzantium (2017-2019)</h2><p>One of the top crypto agencies during the ICO era. Co - founded it. Helped raise $150M+.</p><p><strong>What worked:</strong> Major clients. Industry reputation. Real momentum.</p><p><strong>What didn't:</strong> Markets crash. They always do eventually.</p><p><strong>The lesson:</strong> Reputation is the only asset that survives cycles.</p><hr><h2>Humanic ICO (2016-2017)</h2><p>Marketing Director. Raised ~5,000 BTC. Built every channel myself.</p><p><strong>The lesson:</strong> Full - stack marketing - where you understand the whole machine - wins.</p><hr><h2>MaxUp Agency (2013-2015)</h2><p>Traditional marketing agency. HVAC clients. Stable revenue. Taught myself how to sell.</p><p><strong>The lesson:</strong> Sales builds confidence. Everything else is easier after you learn to sell.</p><hr><h2>B2B Marketing Course (2020-2021)</h2><p>Wrote and taught a deep professional course. Thousands of students. Industry recognition.</p><p><strong>The lesson:</strong> Teaching forces clarity. Clarity scales impact.</p>"
