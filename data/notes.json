My first \"career years\" were extremely hard, chaotic, and absurdly underpaid.</p><p>Since 14, I tried almost every teen and student job available.</p><p>Since 18, I've been an entrepreneur and marketer — building and working with multi-hundred-million-dollar organizations, mostly in crypto.</p><hr><p>I've been in crypto for more than a decade now.</p><p>As a believer. A researcher. A user. An investor.</p><p>I'm still deeply grateful that it exists. I still believe it can help us build a better future.</p><p>But I'd be lying if my awe wasn't mixed with cynicism and tiredness after watching so many scams, incompetence, and endless drama.</p><p>You grow up fast in this industry.</p><hr><p>My last company, Eight Forces, I exited in 2024.</p><p>Since then, I've mostly been experimenting with new product ideas, helping companies build growth systems, managing my capital, and trying to become a better human.</p><p>Not necessarily in that order.</p><hr><p>I believe there are only two questions that really matter:</p><p><em>How to live a good life?</em><br><em>How to be a good person?</em></p><p>To live a good life, you have to be a good person.</p><p>What is \"good\"?</p><p>It's what feels good in your body: warmth, peace, laughter, being with friends, being useful, being appreciated — you know it when you feel it.</p><p>But nowhere close to feeling good is greed, anger, harming people, lying, cheating, stealing, being mean, overthinking, fearing, obeying blindly, or living in poverty.</p><p>None of that feels good in your body.</p><hr><p>To know real things, you must feel them.</p><p>Intelligence and logic are tools. You only need them to solve quests.</p><p>But life is not a quest.</p><p>It's an experience.</p><hr><p>I try to be humble, chill, caring, reliable, and proactively helpful.</p><p>Not perfectly. Just honestly.</p><p>I'm grateful to be surrounded by people who try to live the same way.</p><hr><p>I'm a foodie.</p><p>Honestly, that's my main motivation to travel — and sometimes even to leave the house.</p><p>I'm also into tea, yoga, Eastern philosophy, and other strange, beautiful things that help me stay grounded.</p><hr><p>Recently, I've been upgrading my skills with AI tools.</p><p>I work with Cursor, Claude, Comet, n8n, and others.</p><p>They allow me, solo, to build apps, automate operations, design systems, and multiply content and distribution by 10x–100x.</p><hr><p>But building solo is not as much fun as building with smart, ambitious, like-minded people.</p><p>So if you're one of them, <a href='#contact'>let's chat</a>.</p>"

      "content": "<p>Chronological. Honest. No spin.</p><p>Every project taught me something. Some lessons cost more than others.</p><hr><h2>Attention Labs (2025-Present)</h2><p>Growth and strategy work: applying business fundamentals that have worked for a century, supercharged with AI tools. The goal is simple: help teams do 10-100x more without burning out.</p><p><strong>What's working:</strong> Built frameworks that actually stick. Integrated AI into real workflows (not just demos). Helped teams move faster while staying sane.</p><p><strong>What's still messy:</strong> Early days. Still experimenting. Still figuring out how to explain what we do without sounding like everyone else.</p><p><strong>The lesson:</strong> Tools matter. But thinking clearly matters more.</p><hr><h2>Quid (2024-2025)</h2><p>Crypto-native card + IBAN built on Hyperliquid. Real product, real demand, real regulatory headaches.</p><p><strong>What worked:</strong> Strong community from day one. Designed UX that made sense to actual crypto users. Proved there's appetite for this.</p><p><strong>What didn't:</strong> Underestimated how slow fintech moves. Regulatory complexity ate our speed. Operational overhead was brutal.</p><p><strong>The lesson:</strong> Fintech isn't a product problem. It's legal, ops, and patience - mostly patience.</p><hr><h2>Eight Forces (2023-2024)</h2><p>Web3 growth agency. Worked with projects that raised tens of millions and hit 9 - figure valuations.</p><p><strong>What worked:</strong> Record campaigns. Real results. Strong reputation.</p><p><strong>What didn't:</strong> Scaling culture is hard. Burnout was a real risk - for me and the team.</p><p><strong>The lesson:</strong> Systems scale. Chaos doesn't. No matter how smart the chaos is.</p><hr><h2>Intropia (2021-2023)</h2><p>Decentralized recruitment platform. Solo founder. Built a network of hundreds of top crypto people.</p><p><strong>What worked:</strong> Raised from great angels. Built something real. Created genuine community.</p><p><strong>What didn't:</strong> Never cracked monetization. Timing was off.</p><p><strong>The lesson:</strong> Being early feels like being smart. Until you realize you're just waiting.</p><hr><h2>Frontrunners / Make It in Ukraine (2018-2021)</h2><p>Recruitment agency connecting EU/US companies with Ukrainian talent. Built a strong reputation with major tech companies.</p><p><strong>What worked:</strong> Great clients. Good revenue. Real impact on people's careers.</p><p><strong>What didn't:</strong> Services hit a ceiling. Hard to scale without breaking quality.</p><p><strong>The lesson:</strong> Service businesses trade time for money. That's not leverage.</p><hr><h2>BHSL Community (2019-2022)</h2><p>Weekly founder breakfasts in Kyiv. Started as an experiment, became a real community that's still running.</p><p><strong>What worked:</strong> Genuine relationships. No agenda. People kept showing up.</p><p><strong>What didn't:</strong> Never monetized it.</p><p><strong>The lesson:</strong> Not everything needs to make money. Some things are just worth doing.</p><hr><h2>Robonomics (2020-2021)</h2><p>IoT meets blockchain. CMO role. Took it from $4M to $80M market cap.</p><p><strong>What worked:</strong> Massive attention. Boston Dynamics integration. Story that resonated.</p><p><strong>What didn't:</strong> Market volatility hit hard.</p><p><strong>The lesson:</strong> Great narrative + real tech = force multiplier. But you can't control the market.</p><hr><h2>Sustainable Rentals (2019-2020)</h2><p>Eco - friendly rental business. Happy customers, strong brand, bad unit economics.</p><p><strong>The lesson:</strong> Loving what you do doesn't mean it'll make money.</p><hr><h2>Custom Paintings (2018-2019)</h2><p>Personalized art e - commerce. Good revenue, loyal customers, seasonal ceiling.</p><p><strong>The lesson:</strong> Know your ceiling before you hit it.</p><hr><h2>Byzantium (2017-2019)</h2><p>One of the top crypto agencies during the ICO era. Co - founded it. Helped raise $150M+.</p><p><strong>What worked:</strong> Major clients. Industry reputation. Real momentum.</p><p><strong>What didn't:</strong> Markets crash. They always do eventually.</p><p><strong>The lesson:</strong> Reputation is the only asset that survives cycles.</p><hr><h2>Humanic ICO (2016-2017)</h2><p>Marketing Director. Raised ~5,000 BTC. Built every channel myself.</p><p><strong>The lesson:</strong> Full - stack marketing - where you understand the whole machine - wins.</p><hr><h2>MaxUp Agency (2013-2015)</h2><p>Traditional marketing agency. HVAC clients. Stable revenue. Taught myself how to sell.</p><p><strong>The lesson:</strong> Sales builds confidence. Everything else is easier after you learn to sell.</p><hr><h2>B2B Marketing Course (2020-2021)</h2><p>Wrote and taught a deep professional course. Thousands of students. Industry recognition.</p><p><strong>The lesson:</strong> Teaching forces clarity. Clarity scales impact.</p>"

      "content": "<p>I don't share this to flex. I share it because how someone invests reveals how they think.</p><h2>Where I Started</h2><p>I grew up in a family where \"investing\" wasn't a concept. No one ran a business. No one talked about markets. We had apartments inherited from Soviet times. No one knew they were \"assets.\"</p><p>My first real investment was Bitcoin in 2016, at $600. Bought it with money I'd earned selling marketing services. That changed everything.</p><p>I'd spent two years forming my thesis, reading everything, getting deeply bullish on crypto. The moment I had money to invest, I did.</p><p>That early conviction shaped me but also created bias. Over the years I've made absurd amounts of money in crypto and lost much of it. Bad allocation. Trusting the wrong people. Learning expensive lessons.</p><p>Through many iterations, I've developed a clearer view of how I want to invest.</p><h2>Crypto</h2><p>Still my largest allocation. Still where I have the most conviction and edge.</p><p><strong>Bitcoin.</strong> The only true alternative asset class. Unlimited liquidity. Censorship-resistant. Full self-custody. I treat it as a long-term store of value, not a trade.</p><p><strong>Hyperliquid.</strong> My highest-conviction bet outside Bitcoin. It sits at the intersection of the two most profitable niches in crypto: trading infrastructure (taking share from Binance) and Layer 1 blockchains (competing with Ethereum and Solana). Also the first project that feels like an honest alternative to the VC-backed token model.</p><p><strong>Solana.</strong> Excellent technology, team, and communication. They ship constantly. I've had great trades here and I'm rebuilding my position.</p><p><strong>What I avoid.</strong> Anything with heavy VC backing and the \"low float, high FDV\" playbook. These tokens are designed to extract value from retail.</p><p><strong>Speculation.</strong> I enjoy speculating on current narratives like memecoins and AI agents. But I size these as casino bets, not investments.</p><h2>Real Estate</h2><p>After 10 years in crypto, I wanted to diversify into physical assets.</p><p>My thesis: real estate isn't always the best return, but it's valuable when you find the right opportunity. I think about it in three categories:</p><p><strong>The specific deal.</strong> In any market, you can find asymmetric deals if you look. My Bali investment was like this. Bought during construction chaos, waited a year, and now it's appreciating.</p><p><strong>The location thesis.</strong> I'm bullish on coastal living. Remote work is permanent. Successful people are seeking better climate, communities, and tax environments. I invest where they'll want to live: Bali, Dubai, Madeira.</p><p><strong>Early-stage edge.</strong> All my real estate investments had a reason to buy now rather than later. Bali during disruption. Dubai during construction, years before completion. Madeira at a very early stage through a well-connected local contact.</p><p>I treat real estate like venture: small asymmetric bets with some personal edge in timing, relationships, or taste.</p><h2>Traditional Assets</h2><p>Holding cash in dollars means losing money slowly.</p><p>I keep a portion in index funds and commodities. Not exciting. That's the point. Stability while other bets play out.</p><h2>Exploring</h2><p>Areas I'm interested in but don't have active positions yet:</p><ul><li>Critical infrastructure</li><li>Wellness and longevity</li><li>Medical innovation</li></ul><h2>Principles</h2><p><strong>1. Invest in what you understand.</strong> My best returns came from crypto because I spent years building conviction first.</p><p><strong>2. Size matters.</strong> Asymmetric bets should be sized so you can be wrong multiple times and still win overall.</p><p><strong>3. People matter.</strong> My worst losses came from trusting the wrong people. My best wins came from backing the right ones.</p><p><strong>4. Cash is a position.</strong> Sometimes the best investment is waiting.</p><p><em>This is how I think today. It'll evolve.</em></p>"

The things that tell you what a place is actually like.</p><p>Most of these countries I visited for business, but I always carve out a week to explore on my own. Walk around. Eat. Watch how people live.</p><p>Below are my honest impressions.</p><hr><h2>Europe</h2><details><summary>🇺🇦 Ukraine</summary><p>My home.</p><p>Born here. Lived here. Love it deeply.</p><p>Beautiful country. Strong people. Rich culture.</p><p>What's happening now hurts.</p><p>Still: I hope everyone will visit Ukraine one day. It deserves it.</p></details><details><summary>🇧🇾 Belarus</summary><p><em>2018</em></p><p>Nice people. Clean streets. Calm cities.</p><p>But… You constantly feel: Surveillance. Control. Fear.</p><p>After 2020, I wouldn't recommend going.</p><p>It's sad. It had potential.</p></details><details><summary>🇵🇱 Poland</summary><p>Been several times.</p><p>As a tourist destination, neutral. As a country, huge respect.</p><p>What Poland built in 30 years is impressive. Economically. Socially. Structurally.</p><p>Respect.</p></details><details><summary>🇳🇴 Norway</summary><p>Nature: insane. Like screensaver-level.</p><p>I sailed along the coast. Small towns. Mountains. Water everywhere.</p><p>Magical.</p><p>Also: Very expensive. Like… very.</p></details><details><summary>🇩🇪 Germany</summary><p>Been many times: Berlin, Frankfurt, Düsseldorf.</p><p>I like German people. I like how things work. I love the techno scene.</p><p>Berlin in summer = top-tier Europe.</p><p>Highly recommended.</p></details><details><summary>🇳🇱 Netherlands</summary><p>Amsterdam, Rotterdam.</p><p>Amazing: Architecture. Urban design. Services. Shops.</p><p>Plus: First to legalize recreational cannabis. Respect.</p><p>Must visit. Just… not in winter. November = depression.</p></details><details><summary>🇫🇷 France</summary><p>I love France.</p><p>Language. Music. Food. People.</p><p>A lot of stereotypes are wrong.</p><p>Yes, society is struggling now. Yes, politics is messy.</p><p>Still: As a travel destination, excellent. As a culture, beautiful.</p><p>French people are much nicer than people think.</p></details><details><summary>🇪🇸 Spain</summary><p>Love it. Lived there.</p><p>Barcelona (12+ times). Madrid.

Sicily.</p><p>Still haven't been to Rome or Northern gems.</p><p>Maybe expectations are too high.</p><p>Italy promises heaven. Delivers \"pretty good\".</p><p>Still nice. Just… not life-changing (for me).</p></details><details><summary>🇨🇿 Czech Republic</summary><p>Love it.</p><p>Prague is stunning.

Great culture.</p><p>Politics aside, very solid place.</p></details><details><summary>🇨🇭 Switzerland</summary><p>Switzerland is unreal.</p><p>I think it's impossible to find anything ugly there.</p><p>Everything works.

Los Angeles.</p><p>America is special.</p><p>You can find anyone and anything here.</p><p>In one day in San Francisco, you can see: The richest people on Earth. The poorest people on Earth. The smartest. The dumbest.</p><p>Sometimes on the same street.</p><p>It's insanely diverse. Economically. Culturally. Mentally.</p><p>I love the US.</p><p>It's probably not my natural \"home vibe\".
